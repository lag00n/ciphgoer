* What is that?

Basically, that is a simple encoding/decoding tool that aims to do that job using multiple well known cipher methods. 
I did this mainly for some learning purposes and for the hobby, but I do really hope that can be useful for someone sometime. Have fun using it!
Please notice that is WIP, so expect bugs. Any contributions are appreciated!

* Currently supported ciphers
- Vigenere cipher
- Caesar cipher

* Planned Features

- [ ] Usage on text files. (Both as input or output)
- [ ] GUI and better CLI experience
- [ ] Golang library 

=Install instructions and usage help are going to be added soon=
