#+TITLE: ciphgoer, a simple tool to encode/decode text
#+AUTHOR: lxg00n

* What is that?

Basically, that is a simple encoding/decoding tool that aims to do that job using multiple well known cipher methods. 
Currently, only caesar cipher is supported, but that's a WIP, so a plenty of cipher methods are being implemented. 
I did this mainly for some learning purposes and for the hobby, but I do really hope that can be useful for someone sometime. Have fun using it!

* Planned Features

- [ ] Usage on text files. (Both as input or output)
- [ ] GUI and better CLI experience
- [ ] Golang library 

* TODOs

*** Improve CLI (the actual one is just a sketch)
*** Create GUI/TUI (it doesn't even exist yet)
*** Fix/find better approaches to some spaggethi code.

=Install instructions and usage help are going to be added soon=
